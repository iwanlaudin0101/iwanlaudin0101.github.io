**News Classification:** An Indonesian news classification system using LSTM method trained with 10 thousand news articles consisting of 5 categories (Entertainment, Sports, Showbiz, Technology, and Headlines).

After I completed the modeling process for classifying news articles, I refined the model by implementing a deployment model using the Python library Flask.

### Email Spam Detection: TF-IDF and Machine Learning Models

To predict whether a message is spam, I first vectorize the text message into a format that a machine learning algorithm can understand using TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model consisting of Naive Bayes and Random Forest to learn to distinguish between normal and spam messages.
